**Vulkalc** is a cross-platform library for easy GPU calculations with the use of **Vulkan**, 
developed by [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/). It will provide ready-to-use functions for most common 
calculations and will let you use your own calculation shaders.

**Vulkalc** eliminates the need to configure **Vulkan** manually and concentrate on your calculations.

## How to use

Manual will be available later

## Dependencies
