**Vulkalc** is a cross-platform library for easy GPU calculations with the use of **Vulkan**(developed by [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/)).
It provides some ready-to-use basic functions for vectors and maxtrix operations
and lets you use your own calculation shaders.

**Vulkalc** eliminates the need to configure **Vulkan** manually and lets you concentrate on your calculations.
